# Compact React

This CLI tool is used to quickly create a simple React project.
It is based on a simple Webpack and Babel configuration that is viewable
[here](https://github.com/mblydenburgh/no-cra-template).

To start using, first install by running `npm i -g compact-react`. Once installed,
start creating a new project by running `compact-react [insert project name]` from
a terminal window.

Currently, the only customization is choosing a Javascript or Typescript configuration. This
is decided in the terminal after creating an initial project.
